### Recursion

### Overview

In the Recursion test specs we will practice writing recursive functions.  The idea behind recursion is that a function calls itself until it reaches a condition, known as the base case. Recursion is very useful when you want to break a large, complex problem into multiple smaller problems. Additionally, recursion can help you think in a Functional Programming context.
